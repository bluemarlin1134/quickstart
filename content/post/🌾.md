title: How seeds Grow
---
### Germination
- plants disperse seeds
	- a seed is an embryo and a food store enclosed in a coat
    - the embryo will start to use the food store in the seed and grow into a new young plant
    	- conditions needed
        	- water
            - oxygen
            - enzymes

### Dormancy
- seeds lay around until the right conditions
- seeds must have at least 5 - 20% water
- the seed must start to photosynthesize befor all the food is used

### Water
- activates enzymes in seed
- converts starch to sugar and proteins to amino acids

### Oxygen
- the testa is impermiable so befor any oxygen can enter the seed the testa must split
- O2 provides energy

### Temperature
- germination occours best a 40 degrees celsius
- above 45 degrees celsius enzymes in the cell are denatured

### Light
- plants grow from seeds which are just below the surface
- in most seeds light is not needed for germination
- some plants need light before they germinate
    - foxglove
    - certain types of lettuce
