title: Milan!

If I get this post written today, I will finally be ahead!

We, well at least I did, woke up refreshed and ready to get on the flight to Bergamo airport in Milan, Italy. So early that morning we set out to the Bus sation to catch the bus to Ovda airport. There was alot of people like us travelling yesterday so the first bus got filled quickly, so fast, we couldn't get a seat! Then the next bus came,a dn that one filled up so quickliy... you guessed it, we couldn't get a single seat. In the end we ended up standing for 45 minutes. I did catch some pretty cool pictures of the Eygpt/Israel border. We had had a sandstorm the day before so the sky was still  filled with dust...  thats why the pictures are so bad... sorry.

By the way, I know what your'e thinking, "A sandstorm!" Well, yes, it really affected the lower part of Eilat nearer the desert, but we got alot of wind mostly.

There is alot of security in Israel when boarding a flight. First, they give you a little interveiw about where you are from, and where you are going, what you are doing... Then they scan your bags. Funny thing happened here, the TSA lady who was there told two ladies to move, and put their stuff on the scanner. One of them hesitated, and started whispering to the other one. So the TSA lady yells. "What you looking at!" Needless to say, they hesitated no more. 

When they scan your bags if they find **anything** that looks the slightest supicious they give you a chemical test. They you check in. After you check in, they give you the real check.  They check your passports for the third time, scan your bags again, and also scan all of your electronics seperately. Once they finish that, they check your passports ***again***, then, and only then, may you proceed to the gate.

After them checking our passports again for the 6th time, we boarded our flight to Bergamo airport in Milan.
 
The flight was good, I fell asleep ike 5 times. I got some very nice pictures of Greece, and some other places from the sky. If I don't upload them tonight, I'll upload them tommorow.

When we got off the flight, the border guard, when he saw Dads passport, was like: "Oooh Bahamas." So he went and showed it to  his friend. Then looked it up on his phone, and was like: "Ohhh, nice beaches. Swimming pigs! Wow." Anyway.... my first impressions of Italy were no exactly that great. There is calot of graffiti there, so if you do see a nice building or something, it always seems to be messed up. If ny of you Italian graffiti artist are reading this, **STOP** your making me dislike your country!

Our ride from the airport to the central bus station was not long, so I didn't bother taking many pictures, and when I make the gallery I will put them there.

Well, its getting late, so I think I will publish this, and put the rest up tommorow.

##### Seeya!
