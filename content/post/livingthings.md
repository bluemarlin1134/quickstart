## What do living things have in common?
> There are two main classes of living things. Plants, and Animals.

### Living things
- they reproduce or produce offspring simular to their kind
- they grow
- they react to external stimuli
- most move
    - things like sea sponges move as tiny sponges but as they grow, they develop a“cesile lifestyle”[1]
    - things like plants move, but in a different manner, such as the “Morning Glory” which moves with the sun.
- make and excrete waste
    - plants produce sap, which is counted as waste
- They take in and let out air
- All living things need nutrition
