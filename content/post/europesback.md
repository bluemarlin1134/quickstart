[^1]: A sad interpretation of Plato's Republic...

Out of all the countries I have been to so far, except for some in the U.S.A, Jerusalem is my favorite. Sadly though all good things must come to an end... to make place  for the better ones! [^1] So buckle in your seat belts, and grab your bags, we're heading back to Eilat! 

Our journey began at 8:00 am, Mr.Hussein was supposed to pick us up at 9 am, get his money, and then take us to the central bus station. Now, at 9 am, no one showed up so, not ones to miss the bus to Eilat, we left without him. This is really funny what happens here. We decided that the walk to the central bus station would be something of a herculean task to make the bus before eleven. So we got a cab. 

The cab driver only took cash though so dad had to go get some money out the bank. The thing is though the ATM isn't really the closest thing either. So Dad told the cab driver to take us to the nearest ATM enroute to the Central Bus Station.  When we got there though the card for some reason didn't work... In he end, to make a shrot story shorter, we got kicked out the cab. SO, we walked to the next nearest atm, which actually hapened to be across the road. For some strange reason, the ATM WORKED!!! Serves that mean old taxi driver right to leave us right there in the rain. Oh, did I mention it was raining? Now out of a city packed with 800 million people whose car do we see, and who do you think sees us? Mr. Hussein!

So we gave Mr.Hussein his money, he drove us to the Central bus station, and after much waiting, and a little ill fated shopping, we got on the 444 bus to Eilat.

Here is some pics I took on the way.

On the trip, there was this **really** loud and annoying french girl, who laughed and giggled all the way there... for FOUR HOURS!

There was also something else, but I'll put that in my funny things post.

Eilat was warm when we got there compared to the freezing cold we endured in Jerusalem. Our arrival time was pretty close to sunset, so we had to hurry up and get to the Hotel and buy food. 

Here's picture of the hotel.

Funny thing happened there. When we got to the room that Dad had got, we weren't too impressed. The couch was sunk in on one side, the remote to the tv was caked with gunk, and overall it was overall just dirty. So Mom obviously wasn't too happy. Well we got half settled in, and hooked up the phones to the wifi, when we get this text from the owner of the place where we booked it. 

> "Please confirm. I have switched your room from  room 3 to room 4. Please confirm."

So we hiked on over to room four, and it was lke night and day! Overall we had a good stay in the hotel.

After Sabbath, we walked out to see the town, because we hadn't seen much of it that day. We saw some amazing Hotels, and went to this mall. They have this booth there, where thay let theese fish eat the dead skin and germs off your skin.

At around 10 or 11, we got back to the hotel, ready the next morning to set off for Italy.
