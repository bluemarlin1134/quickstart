So I decided to write a book a few years ago It was gonna be on random things that come into my head from alphabetical order. Since this section of my website seemed to be lacking, I decided I would type parts of it up and put it on here. Maybe someone might get a laugh out of it.

# A

The letter "A" is a really wonderful letter, becuse it happens to be the first letter. Now personally the letter "E" is my favorite, because it's the first letter of my name... It coinciedentally is also the most popular. (conceited smile).

Now, for a letter that begins with "a"... "Arrogance".
You know, Arrogance is really something that burns me up. I once knew this boy, He was a good old chap most of the time, but he would rather die than admit to you he didn't know something, or how to do something in fact. One time we were sitting around the camp chatting (we were camping), and I go and stretch out of tiredness I guess. Well I happen to be double jointed [^1] So I clasped my hands together, stretched out my arms, and without taking them apart, I rotated them 360 degrees around myself. Now I didn't think about it at first, but me being double jointed made that boy outright **Jealous!**  How do I know? Because that night as I was walking back to my camp, He comes over and is like: 

ðŸ¤¥ him: "I can do that too ya' know."

ðŸ¤  me: "Oh really? What?"

ðŸ¤¥ him: "Twist my arm around like that."

ðŸ¤  me: "Like what?"

ðŸ¤¥ him: "You know, when you twist it around your head."

ðŸ¤  me: "Oh really?! Do it!"

Now he tried, and I'll give him points on that, but he didn't do it. Now you may say. "Oh that doesn't mean he was jealous." Well, if every conversation after that was about how good he is at twisting his arms around his body... and he won't talk to you **unless** he is asking you to do it again, just to see how you do it... sounds pretty jealous to me. ðŸ¤” Frankly, I wish I had never done it in the first place. ðŸ˜“

On the other hand, I knew this other boy. Now he was the most humble, low to earth, error admitting, friendship needing person that ever walked the earth. And I find he was a bit too... I don't know what to call it. But somethimes it made me really sorry that he didn't know... Oh I don't know... maybe **HOW TO PLAY LEGOS!!!** 

Unless you live in a hole, you must know how o play legos! It should be taught in schools! Children should have to take test on how to play legos! It should be **manditory!!** ðŸ˜ 

Okay, that's all Im gonna write for this part, I'll put the rest of "A" up later.
