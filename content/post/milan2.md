title: Milan! part 2
---

I might have some problems writing and publishing this post... so **bear** with me with the **tipos**. 

So now I will begin where I left off. The bus ride to Milan wasn't the greatest in scenery, unless you like graffiti. When we arrived at the central bus station, Dad and Mom opted to go to the supermarket instead of heading directly to the hotel, because we didn't know what time we would arrive.

uTheir bananas looked terrible ðŸ˜£ but... so does Walmart bananas.

We then had to take the metro to another bus stop, and then had to walk to the hotel, but we were already lost on stage 2 of the journey.

We actually did really well with communication! Dad speaks good Spanish, and Italian isn't that different, so that helped. Now, imagine this there is this gigantic city, in a country of millions, and we are on a busy road, in the evening, walking, dead lost, not even knowing where we were. As we are walking this lady calls to us and says: 

"Vida Luna?" 

Dad looked at her and was like: "Yes!"  

"You are Craig?" She asked.

We all answered yes.

Well we found out that the lady who runs the hotel, saw us and...  just musta thought we looked like her hotel guest!

Anyway, where this hotel was located we would still be there looking for it.

Now... when I say fancy looking, I mean fancy! From the shower head on down. But I have another post to write tonight so I wont go into details. Sadly though, I have all the pictures on my go pro... and we are currently in a dilemma with my laptop which I will explain later in the next post...

##### Seeya!
