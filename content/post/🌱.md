##### All green plants are **Autotrophic**.
- means Self-feeding

Plants make their own food from CO2, H2O, AND mineral ions (from the soil).

The process is driven by energy from the sunlight.
- enzymes enable the plant to make the carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, and the nutrients it needs.

### Osmosis
- as water leaves the plant, water from the ground enters the plant.
- water is lost by traspiration from the leaves
- water and dissolved ions enter the xylem vessel
- water and dissolved ions are drawn into the plant through root hair cells

> Plants are the basis for most food chains...
