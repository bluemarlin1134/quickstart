title: Morrocco Part 1
---

Now, I will explain to you my so called laptop dillemma. On April 1, a Monday, We headed to Bergamo airport in Milan. It was a very nice ride. I'm gonna digress here a little bit, BEWARE of Italian bus drivers! These people are nuts! They must keep one hand on the wheeel, and one hand on the horn. One of our bus drivers, the same on that carried us to Milan, one car got infront of his way, and he started yelling, and waving his hands and leaning on the horn... The, funny thing was, I dont know if you wanna call this funny, the rest of the way, he mumbled to himself about it  ***for two hours***.

Anyway, we had a hangup at the airport, but managed to catch our flight from Bergamo to Marrakech airport. For a while there while flying, the turbulence got really bad, but thankfully we arrived in one piece. We arrived at 10 o'clock, or "half ten" as the guy said when I asked im the time, and my first thoughts about Morrocco: *"Boy! It is cold!"* Later I realized that the weather in Morrcco just can't make up it's mind. It's cold one minute, and the next minute your'e reaching for your scarf and jacket. It is really strange... 

At immigration, they only take you one by one, so Moshe and I had to get in a different line, which obviously disturbed Mom, but the guy was really nice, and gave me absolutely no problem. *Welcome to Morrocco!*

Driving is not one of Morrocco's specialties. I heard a rumor that people there are supposed to drive on the right side of the road, but they drive at any speed, and on any side that pleases them. It is hard to explain how bad it is... Our first experience of this was when we stepped out of the airport. Mom asked directions to the Riad Kech our hotel... which we found out no on ever had heard of it... the guy though he would take us to it... he took us to the wrong one... and told us it would be **150 DIRHAM!!!** Needless to say we all thought he was crazy for even suggesting a price like that... Well,  he must of noticed the look on our faces, because he then added that it would only be 15 euro... Ohhh, conversion rate! We gave a sigh of relief, and proceeded to pay the guy. Come to find out we only had 15 euro cash on us.

So, when you enter the old city in Morrocco, you have to drive though the gates of the city, which were made for donkeys, and not for gigantic two ton cars. So while your driving though theese narrow gates you have like 5 cars all trying to get though at the same time, and a few scooters trying to get arround thouse cars. By the way there are mopeds, scooters, and motorcycles all throughout Morrocco, and we found out later that there are 90,000 scooters registered in Marrakech alone!
We had so many near misses that night... it was crazy.

In the end, with a little bit of walking included, our driver managed to find the Riad Kech, our hotel. From the outside, it looked really... unglamorous. It was in a narrow side street, in a narrower corner, with a sign, that I didn't even notice was there until the next day. Anyway, the driver knocked at the door for us, and the manager, later to find out was also the waiter, the cleaner, and the **best mint tea maker on the face of this planet**, Mr. Yousef, answered the door. We walked into the first room there, which I assumed was the lobby. It had a big fountain in the  middle of it, two couches, and some very big curtains on the wall. Looked kinda like the lobby at a Laquinta or something like that. So when he said: "Well, welcome, this is your room." And then handed us the keys, I think all of us, at least I know I was like. "**I LOVE MORROCCO!**" Really though, what were they thinking by putting a fountain in the middle of the room? (I'm not complaining.)

There were, including the living room, the bathroom, the master bed room, and another bed room with three twin sized beds in it.

Now this is where things get funny. So Dad had reserved the room, but had not paid for it yet, a custom that is done on that side o the world quite often. So we wwent up like 2 flights of stairs, plus another spiral staircase where Mr. Yousef lives. Mom signed some papers, and He pulled out a credit card machine from under His matress. Mom handed him her credit card, and he went to stick it into the slot... "Wait!" Mom said, it's a swipe card, you have to swipe it. 

"What?" He asked. "I have never seen this before."

Mr. Yousef was so used to seeing and using a chip card, he never had even seen a swipe card. Mom, had to teach him how to use one. See, people in Africa, on the other side of the world, don't even use swipe cards anymore!!! By the way, that is a plead to our Bank to update their credit cards. So we walked back down our spiral staircase, and back down two flights of stairs, to our room to get ready for bed.

The Shower in our room a dome, make out of clay, and was so big, it was like a room, inside a room. But the highlight of our hotel was not the shower, but the mattress. **Theese matresses are SO HARD!** They feel like they are stuffed with cardboard! Come to find out they are traditionally stuffed with sheeps wool. I didn't realize this at first when  I flopped on the bed, and the whole bed moved and I ended up on the floor. But, don't get me wrong, I slept really good on them.

Well, I have some more to right, but I'll put the other stuff in the next post.

##### Seeya!
