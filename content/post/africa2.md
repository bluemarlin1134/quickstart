title: Morrocco part 2
---

Mr. Yousef, last night had told us that for 3 euros we could have breakfast by him. So, at 9 thirty or 10 we headed back up the stairs to go get breakfast. I have to say, it was *really good*. We had: tea, coffee, this type of bread that is like a tougher crepe, bread, marmalade, cream cheese, a type of cake, and oranges. Pretty good for three euros. We told Mr. Yousef, that our driver last night, offered to take us aroung the city. Mr. Yousef, this became quite a trait, told us that you don't need a driver to go around Marakech, and it is, notice the "safer", "**Safer**, to do it on foot." 

"Well, obviously it is safer to do it on foot", I thought, "how they drive over here, anything is safer than driving!""

Come to find out, walking is just as dangerous.

As soon as we walked out the door we had to pin ourselves up against the wall because of the amount of mopeds comming down the road!

That's a picture of the road that the Riad Kech was on. Mom decided we should go further down the same road and see what was there. While walking through, I saw this guy making leather bags, and purses. I saw one that I thoought would be good to put my computer in, so I asked how much it was. 

Rule 1: Don't assume people know english in Morrocco
Rule 2: Don't be afraid to ask if the person speaks english.

Because I forgot both rules, we ended up in a hand waving match trying to figure out what eachother was saying. Kinda like with Abu Ali in Hebron. The guy finally got his sister who speaks a ***little*** english. 

Now this is was our man problem in Morrocco, when asking a price, don't get scared when the guy says 800 dirham, or a large number like that. You must remember, the conversion rate to euros is **ten to one**. So when the guys sister, says 800, we start trying to figure out if that is dirham or euro. And becuase we didn't know the conversion rate, we ended up, like hebron again, pulling out calculators... in the end we realized the bag cost 80 dollars.

The guys sister, the one who helped us, took us to her restaurant, just on the other side of the street. Now, morroccan food looks good, smells good, but taste **AMAZING!** We decided we wouldn't get anything from her then, but we told her, with of course a little help from our friend google translate, that we would be back around two p.m. to have dinner. So, we headed off down the corner, to find what we we going to find.

Around the corner we met a man selling more bags, leather ones, he told us... acually that's the funny thing, they don't ever tell you a straight price in Morocco, because they expect you to name your own price, and start bartering. We did find out though, that he "expected" (my own words) to get *around* 280 dirham. Now we still didn't get through our heads the exchange rate between dirham and dollar, so again, we freaked out, we at least I did, we we heard that number.

Did I explain my love for the souk? It is like a farmers market on steriods, you can get fruit, nuts, clothing, medicine, fossils, crystals, sunglasses... the thing is, usually you can get things quite cheap, and it is always fun to walk around the souk, because it can literally go on for miles. So we hiked off to find the souk! ![20190402_124205.jpg](/post/20190402_124205.jpg)

We met this one guy who sold things, it was almost like a "curiosisity shop". He had everything from authentic bayonets from WW2, to metal signs (one which we bought), and Mom was really interested in the rest of the shop too, so we said we would come back tommorow. I really liked the amount of stuff you can see while walking in the souk, and some of the stuff is just absolutely astounding. 

What next happened was, we met this other guy while asking directions to the ATM. His name was Mr. Jimal. We ended up seeing quite a bit of him while on our trip in Morrocco. ANYWAY... He took us down this **really** shady looking side street, (That I musta walked by at least two times, and didn't see.) and all of a sudden, we popped out in the main square! Well, right there was the ATM. Because we again forgot the exchange rate, my extremely tight-handed-on-the-money brother only withdrew 1000 dirham. (Roughly equal to 100 dollars.) To my surprise Mr. Jimal had waited for us during the money trasnaction, and then as he was leading us back to the souk, he said: 

> "I would like to take you somewhere." 

I mean,we could of ran for our lives, cuz, that is a very strange thing to say to someone who you just met, but Morocco is a very different place, the people just aren't very threatening, and are very peaceful. Needless to say, we went with the guy.  We didn't go very far either, and actually went down he same side street once more. All of a sudden Mr. Jimal turns into this "side-tunnel". (Is that a word?) Really though, you know that phrase "hole in the wall"? This was "hole in the wall". You actually have to crouch down to get into there. 

Well first thoughts: 

> "Boy! This place smells good!" 

To find out it was a herbosterie which is where they mix herbs and make oils, and stuff... It looks very proffessional, with every one dressed up in white lab coats, white, floors, and white walls.  Mr. Jimal set us up with one guy, i guessed to show us around the store. Well, we ended up sitting down and him showing us, leting us sample, and telling us about al the Products they show. So I admit, it was pretty good so we boueght some.

When we got out of the store, it did take a while, we walked back out to the square to look around. As we were walking this guy comes up to us, and is like:

> Would you like to take tour to Atlas mountain? Very good, you go with group! I will show you some pictures, come, it will only take a while. 

That it did not.
