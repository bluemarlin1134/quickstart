We woke up that mornig with a firery burning in our minds to do some shopping, but first breakfast. We paid Mr. Yousef 100 dirham a day for breakfast. Before you say: "What!?" (Like I did.) Just remember that it's only 10 dollars. We had decided yesterday to not go on the excursion up to the Atlas mountains, not because we didn't have the money, but because we didn't have enough time. We decided though we would not go and track the man down for our deposit of 100 dirham, being only 10 dollars, and that would add insult to injury by doing that.
