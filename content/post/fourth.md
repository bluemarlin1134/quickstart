title: A Run Down on Some Very Old Scientists

---

### This is a list of old scientist that I did two years ago.
#### Claudius Galen

To some people, a pig may look cute, to some people a pig may look ugly. To Claudius Galen a pig was something to dissect. Born in 130 C.E. Claudius Galenus was a lover of science. He believed in many of Hippocrates theories, and with his dissections of pig and monkeys he added on to Hippocrates. Because pigs are not humans, over 200 of his theories in his over 40 books were proven wrong.

##### Leonardo Da Vinci

One of the greatest minds of his era, he made numerous inventions, Leonardo Da Vinci made numerous discoveries and painted the most valuable painting in the world. Leonardo was a master sculptor, but then moved on to become a scientist. He drew the anatomical man, and made many new discoveries, and detailed drawings of many organs and body structures. For a man who we don’t give enough credit to for his studies in biology, Leonardo da vinci is still known by nearly everyone.

##### Aristotle
Most people view Aristotle as a great philosopher. What most people don’t realize is that Aristotle was one of the founders of the early study of gross anatomy. Since he never dissected a human body, most of his theories were wrong. In spite of this though his findings set the course for the further study of modern anatomy.

##### Andreas Vesalius
At only twenty three years old Andreas Vesalius was a medical wonder of the past. In 1537 Andreas graduated from The University of Padua. One week after graduation he was asked to do a lecture! One year after graduation he had written the first truly scientific book of his era. It was called the Anatomical study. It had detailed drawings of the human body that andreas had done while dissecting them. Sadly though because dissecting human cadavers was considered an offense Andreas was sentenced to death but got the lighter sentence of being forced to take a pilgrimage on the way back in which he died on a ship wreck.

##### Robert Hooke
Nearly everyone knows of Robert Hooke’s famous discovery of cells in a piece of cork, but that british seventeenth century scientist discovered much more than cells. Robert was born July 28, 1703. At only 25 years old he discovered the law of elasticity, and later on in life working with and against his contemporary Isaac Newton, helped in drafting some of Newton’s theories.

##### Herophilus
Some people call Herophilus a butcher and some people call him a mad scientist, but most know him to be the father of anatomy. Born in 320 B.C.E. in Asia minor, Herophilus grew up with an avid love for biology. When he grew older he performed the first systematic dissection of a human cadaver. He also founded in third century B.C.E. the first school of anatomy. What is considered controversial about Herophilus, that not all his dissections were made on corpses, but some being made on living human beings! So whether Herophilus was a gore loving scientist, he made massive contributions to science.
