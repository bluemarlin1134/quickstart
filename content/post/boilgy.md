### Biological organzations
- the larger the organism the more cells it contains.

### Tissues
- animal tissues
    - bone
    - muscles
    - nerves
- Plant tissues
    - xylem
    - phloem
    - pith

### Organs
- animal organs
    - stomach, brain, kidneys
- plant organs
    - root, stem, leaves
- animal organ systems
    - circulatory systems
    - nervous systems
    - respiraory system
    - digestive systems
- plant organ systems
    - the shoot
    
### Organism
- animal
    - human
    - blue whale
    - vulture
- plant
    - oak tree
    - grasses
    - flowering plants

### Plant Structure
- have a root stucture below ground and a rshoot system above the ground
- the shoot is an upright stem with leaves and buds
- the roots anchor the plant into the soil and prevent it being knocked down
- when lateral buds grow, they produce branches
- the **apical bud** (also called the terminal bud) continues the upward growth of the stem
    - both structures produce flowers
- the reigon of the stem from which leaves and buds are produced is called a node
- the products of photo synthesis are passed from the leaves to the stem
- the stem carries glucose and other substances to all parts of the plant and carries water and dissolved salts from the roots to the leaves and flowers
- The stem also supports the entire plant and spaces the leaves so that they can recieve maximum amount of sunlight and absorb CO2 which they need for photo synthesis
- the upright stem holds the flowers above the ground making them easily polinated
