[^1]:Yes I know, like the mushroom

So we arrived safely yesterday! I thought the flight would take longer than it did. We flew on norwegian air from Fort Lauderdale to Gatwick airport in London. It was about a two hour bus ride to Victoria Station. Then we had to make up our minds on which train to take to get to Portabello market. [^1] Mom was trying o find some clothes for us, but we ended up getting shoes for her.  We then went to Tk maxx (no, thats not a typo, that is actually the name of the store.) We got some pants for me and something else I can't remember.

Ok, this probably the hardest part of this trip so far. **Buckherst Hill**  BEWARE!!! It is called  Buckherst **hill**  for a reason
Our hotel was located at the top of the hill and we had to hike with all our luggage **and** groceries to the top of the hill to get checked in.

Anyway we had a good night, and I'm probably gonna get some postcards today.
