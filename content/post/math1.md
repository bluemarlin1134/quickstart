 ### Question 1:
 ---
 > Your car gets 25 miles per gallon, and you want to go on a 400 mile road trip. Right now gas cost 3.00 per gallon. How much will the gas for your road trip cost?

400 miles x gallons per mile

you have 1 gallon for every 25 miles

400 miles x 1/25 = 100/25 gallons = 16 gallons

16 gallons x $3.00 per gallon = $48.00
> Answer: You would need to pay $48.00.
### Question 2:
---
> Jamir is training for a race and is running laps around a field. If the distance around the feild is 300 yard how many **complete laps** would he need to do to run at least 2 miles?

             Note:        There are 5280 feet per mile.

2 miles x 5280 feet per mile = 10560 feet

10560 feet / 3 = 3520 yards

2 miles = 3520 yards

3250 yards / 300 laps = 11...[^1]

> Answer: Jamir would have to run at least 12 laps.
