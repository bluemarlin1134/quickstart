title: Four Letters to Doctor Bentley reveiw
---
## A breakdown for letter one of “Four letters from Sir Isaac Newton to Doctor Bentley Containing Some Arguments in Proof of a Deity”.
#### Okay, I did this one about a year ago as well. Admittedly, could of turned out better…

Sir Isaac Newton (December 25, 1642- March 20,1727) was an english, mathematician, astronomer, theologian, author, and physicist. Isaac newton believed strictly in the bible, and published some letters to a colleague in 1756 called “Four letters from Sir Isaac Newton to Doctor Bentley Containing Some Arguments in Proof of a Deity”. Using a strictly scientific basis, Newton proceeded to explain to doctor bentley some scientific evidence that shows that a higher power does exist. We will be examining one of the four letters that were sent.

The letter is written in a very business like manner, it does not even contain a real greeting! But the beginning is not where the meat of the letter is, but has an introduction of what he is writing about.
Other than the introduction though, Newton says that if every star, planet, and particle, were scattered evenly throughout the universe, and if everything possessed some form of gravity then it would all collide together and form a massive spherical orb. Then he says that if everything was scattered throughout the universe then there would be an infinite amount of clumps in our universe because everything would be attracted by everything else’s gravity.
He then says that he can’t say that natural causes made a sun moon and planets prevented them from being drawn in by each others gravity and put them in perfect order. Furthermore he says that he can’t figure out hout there was a sun was made but none of the other planet were turned into suns, or why the sun instead of being a star just didn’t become many more planets, if it was just natural causes that put them there by chance, and there must be intelligent design or as he calls it, a voluntary agent.

We now get into the “meat”. Newton then explains to bentley that if it was just chance then the sun would of become a gas giant like jupiter or saturn, or again why didn’t jupiter and saturn become a sun. and why the sun was choses to be the sole source of light and heat in our solar system, he can not find any reason except something or someone thought it wise to put it there.

The author then states that the theory that stars drink into planets and planets and comets or meteors, is completely wrong. Then he goes on and claims that the way planets orbit could not of sprung up by chance, because if comets head all over the galaxy and solar system, then why don’t planets do the same. Even if planets were to veer a bit off course or were to slow down or speed up then there would be complete disorder and planet would end up in the same condition as comments. Hence, “Only intelligent counsel very well skilled in mathematics and geometry” to use Newton’s own words put them there.
Further into the writing, Newton then goes back to the theory that if suns turned from stars to comets how the moon, He asks, managed to stay away from being absorbed by one, and why the sun doesn’t just put the moon into its own orbit around itself, if everything was a natural cause.

Newton asserts that he can’t see anything extraordinary in the earth’s axis for proving that the supernatural exist but he says that the orderliness of the seasons ad the perfect tilt it is on could not of just been put there by chance.
At the ending of the letter there is a plain ending, but before doing that he says that there is yet more evidence to come, but he must gather more information and will let it rest for a while.
So there you have it a break down of letter one in layman’s terms.
