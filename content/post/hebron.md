title: Hebron!

[^2]: He said they sell for 8000 dollars each!!! 
Last night, i had a hard time getting to sleep. I mean I was tired, it's just I couldn't get to sleep! I don't think those 5 arab coffees I had yesterday, and that one americano had anything to do with it though.

Mr Hussein showed up right on time to get his money that we owed him from yesteday from our trip to Bethlehem. The hotel manager gave us free breakfast that morning. That was my forst (my first, and my worst) cup of coffee that day. When **<*cough*>** he talked Dad into letting him take us on a trip to Hebron.

"It will be good!" He said. "You will get to see the cave of Macpelah, where Abraham, Issac, Yacob, Rebekah, Sarah buried. Then I will tae you to see Rachel tomb as well!" So in the end after much deliberation, we acepted.



So that moring we found ourselves on a trip to Hebron. As always, the veiws were amazing. ![](/post/travel/veiw5.JPG). Mr.Hussien first took us to the Avrahim Mosque, because they close at 11 a.m. so that the people can pray. The funny thing is, before you can enter, they make the women cover up with these funny robes.

We saw the tombs of Abraham, Issac, and Rebekah. We had to walk over to the jewish side though. Mr. Hussein Since he is Arab, and Muslim, He couldn't go into the jewish side. The tombs were nice... if you could call it that, and I had a relatively good time. I talked with some Jews who asked me if I wanted a Tephilim to pray, and I was like: "Umm... No, Not really. But thankyou!" Mom came over and saved me in the end, and we had a good chat about the Bahamas.

As dad and I were walking back to the Moslem section we got stoped by the gaurds who were like: 

Guard: "Are you Jewish?"

Dad: "Ummm... Yes."

Guard: "No go!"

Me: "What!?"

We finally told us that our driver was over there, and we are... well, she finally andreluctantly let us pass. Whew!

Mr. Hussein was aiting for us on the other side, to take us to the old city to walk around and shop. Dad got us all freshly squeezed pomegranate juice, and one guy managed to get mom to buy a whole necklace set! I'm telling you, when these Arabs  want you to spend, they get you to!

We then went to a place where they blow glass. And the guy literally mad a vase right there in front of us from scratch!

I ended up buying a fish made from glass... I dont know what possesed me to do it.

Okay, this is where things get funny.

Mr.Hussein's son is having a child, so he wanted to get some things for it. So he asks us f he can stop at the toy shop to see if he can buy it. Dad of course said yes and he said we would go with him. On the way to the store Mr.Hussein met his  friend Abu Ali. (Pay attention to that name because things get interesting.) Abu Ali owns the toy shop. So while Mr.Hussein was shopping I picked up an mp3 player, and asked how much it was. Abu Ali only speaks arabic, so when I asked him how much it was, he said: 

Abu Ali: "Khoreaysh." (Sorry, I know I probably butchered that.)

Me: "Umm... What's that in english?"

So we ended up making a  big scene, fingers start going up, we called people who spoke english, we started counting. His son came over, and had a good laugh at our expense... We ended up finding out that that meant 15... after someone pulled out his calculator on his phone and typed it. 

I managed to start a conversation with Osed, Abu Ali's son, and we through much hand signals, and waving had a good time talking with him. I will try to upload those pics later.

There is a picture I found of him.

Then he took me over to his friends coffee shop where he took a picture of me with him, then invited Moshe and I in for Backlava (which by the way is pronounced backlawa.) Then they gave us not one, not two, not three, not four, FIVE arab coffees. They are like the expressos expresso. Small but deadly. Then, mom came in, which the two women employees fell in love with and ended up:

1. Giving Mom more backlava.
2. Giving Mom more coffee.
3. Taking A selfie with Mom.
4. Yelling "We love you!" And nearly breaking out into tears as Mom left the shop.

Meanwhile, Osem and his friend gave me their facebook accounts, I gave them my email. Had a short burst of pictures. I know what youre thinking right now. "I thought you just met them?" I know.

AND IT GETS BETTER!


While in the toy shop we found out that Abu Ali is a Dj, and he taught us a classic Bedouin dance, and showed us some of his parties he goes to.

We aint done yet! He then, took us to see his studio! Then he took us to see his office!

Abu Ali is an antique collector, and has some very cool stuff there. Sorry the pics are so blurry.

THEN, we saw his place wherehe keeps his dj stuff, and he turned it on really loud, and we started dancing, and I got to use the microphone, which as soon as I got it, I had no idea of what to say... and on, and on.

Abu Ali is the last guy on the right.

All this to say, we had a great time, and I know I am missing alot of pictures, but when we get home, and we get the computer going right, I will upload all the other pictures too. I have Some more stuff we saw, Like one of Abu Ali's band members keeps pigeons.[^2] By the way, we also took pictures with them too.
