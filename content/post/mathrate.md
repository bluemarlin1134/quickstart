[^1]: **Do not** **ever** do this on a test!
### -16 = x/4 +2
- -16 - 2 = x/4 +2 -2 | add the 2 on either side
- -18 = x/4  | multiply by four to get the x alone
- 18 * 4 = x * 4 
- -72 = x | x equals negative 72

## Variables on both sides
- both sides have the same variable
### 2x + 3 = 5x - 2 = x + x + 1 + 1 + 1 = x + x + x + x + x -1 - 1 [^1] 
- 2x = x + x
- 3 = 1 + 1 + 1
- 5x = x + x + x + x + x
- -2 = -1 -1

>if you take from one side you **must** take from the other side as well

>You are always trying to get the variable alone.

             16 - 2r = -3r + 6r + 1
             16 - 2r = 3r + 1  |  Combine like terms
             16 - 2r -3r = 3r + 1 -3r  | Subtract 3r from each side
             -5r + 16 = 1  |  combine like terms
             -5r + 16 - 16 = 1 - 16 | subtract 16 from each side
             -5r = -15 | combine like terms
             -5r/-5 = -15/-5 | divide each side by -5
             r = 3 | simplify
