In a few days , I'm gonna be leaving the island! How many days is a few? OH... maybe just one more day! We are going to europe for passover. But after that, we will go to Israel, Poland, Morroco, Venice, Italy, France, One other place I can't remember, and finally back home. 

Sounds like the vacation of a lifetime right? Well... yes it will be great, and I am totally jacked and looking forward to it, but we have no bags. Yes, you heard it. **No bags**. You see, ryan air, and all theese *budget airlines* let you carry on the airplane without making you pay a ridiculous fee, is this:

Ignore the big bag, thats the paid one. The small one is the free. Okay now I don't know about you, but 55 x 40 x 20 seems just a tad bit too small to find anywhere unless it is in the childrens section. So for months we have been looking for a bag that could fit those specs. Now the problem is you don't want anything too small. And you definetly don't want anything too big, becausse customer slaughter will fine you such a big peanlty... yikes!

But you can't find bags all over the place that is just that size. Iv'e called our bag that we haven't gotten yet, the "Quantum Equlibrium Goldylocks X bag" (Just kidding). But Really, finding a bag that size is probably the hardest part in thr preparation to travel. And I'm afraid to say, the deadline is getting very close
