title: Morocco part 3
---

#### I will begin where I left off.

The man invited us up into the building that he was standing by and for the fourth time that morning, we walked up another flight of stairs. (They don't seem to end in Morocco.) We arrived in the attic, which is the storehouse for some of the dresses that they sell downstairs. Anyway, the guy introduces us to his boss and leaves. I didn't get the guys name sadly, even though we spent so long with him. (Wait, I'm getting to it!) In the back of the room, there was a desk with a few chairs and a couch. We sat down, and the guy began to show us how the tour would go.

1. You set off around eight or nine to reach the Atlas mountains
2. You get a traditional breakfast with traditional Berber women in a traditional Berber house... traditionally.
3. You go to the amazing waterfalls and go swimming. 
4. You get out, dont dry yourself yet though because...
5. You get lunch which is served on tables in the middle of a stream!
6. You can ride camels... or just sit around until...
7. You go home.

Now except for number 3, because I don't like swimming with other people, this sounded pretty good! What sounded even better, was he said we could skip this all, and just go ATV riding in the desert. But of course he was not doing this for free so he brought up price. He said it cost 800 dirham for all of us. Well I don't know if that sounds alot to you, but I almost jumped out of my chair when he said 800 dirham. But again, I forgot the coversion rate, when you do it, it only comes out to about 80 euro, maybe 90 give or take a few dollars. The guy noticed our faces to, or maybe just mine, because he said, we could work something out. I think my brother just about then remembered to convert the money, that he said to mom. "It's only 80  bucks Mom." Well, we said we didn't have it, because we didn't, those people at the Marrakech Herbosterie took it, and we asked him if we could pay 100 dirham now and the rest later.

> "I am sorry, that would not be possible."

Well. There was a little moment of silence before someone said, "Let's try the ATM." So back down the stairs we went to get some cash out the ATM. It didn't work. "Well!" He said "Lets try another one!" So we walked over to the next ATM, come to find out it did not do international cards, and it was just giving us a blank screen. So he said for us to try bank to bank transfers, Mom, wisely said not to, it would make more trouble than good. So he said, lets try another ATM, again it didn't work. So he took us to Marrakech Herbosterie, come to find out the casheir there is his brother, to charge the card for 300 dirham. Again, it didn't work. Instead of giving up, like I would of done by now, he took us to another ATM!  By this time I was talking to mom how we could make a break for it. Well he finaly said, that he would take a deposit of our one hundred dirham, and he would refund us it if the money was not on the card tomorrow. 

Well by the time we were done through all of that, out feet were sore, and it was already past 3 o'clock. But we had nothing to hurry to, except the bathroom, and we had, well only Mom got one, a cup of tea.

We were all sufficeiently tired by now so we decided to head back to our hotel. But we were also sufficiently turned around as well, so we decided to ask directions at another hotel. Well... the manager comes up to us and starts asking us about where we are going, and calls one of his employees over. He says to us, why dont you try a walking tour? I have a fully liscensed tour guide, and he will take you around the city... Well the guy said he would only charge us 200 dirham (20 euros) and he would take us to the caspbar, the palaces and the jewish section. Well... we decided to try the card again, belive it or not, it worked! The guy was supposed to take us to our Riad, which is the name for basically a bread and breakfast, but we postponed that for the tour.

The tour guide explained all about the Berber people of Morocco, he actually is one, and so is Mr. Yousef and his cousin, and about the alphabet which is like really old... Our tour guid had a really funny accent. He sounded REALLY British. So when Mom asked us did he live in England at one tim, he told us he had never been out of Morocco, but he used to work with alot of British people and he picked up their accent. 

The jewish quater is now a big market place, you can't really tell there were any Jews there at all. The tour guide said though that the Jews built balconies unlike the other people. Come to find out, there were balconies on the houses. They also built a gigantic wall that goes right around it. He said that the big commodity in that area was salt, and gold (of course) and thats what the Jews used to trade there. Sadly though he said, when the state of Israel ws created, most of them left, and went there. Only a few thousand Jews live in Morocco now.

We saw the palaces, but did not go inside either of them, because one the guide said was not as imprssive as the other, and the other was really expensive. We did go inside the courtyard of the Bahai Palace. There were some amazing looking oranges there, but He said that they are used only for marmalade because they are really bitter.

As we were walking to the Caspbar, the fort, somehow we get on the subject of music. Well our tour guide really likes the blues, so he pulles out his phone, puts some on and starts singing. "Ooh yeah! I love that stuff!" He said. As we were leaving the Caspbar we get on the subject of burial. Did you know that all muslims are (or supposed to be) buried on their right side facing towards Mecca?
They face Mecca because that is their holy site, but they get buried on their right side because that is how they sleep. The guide told us that if you sleep on your back you think too much, sleeping on your stomach is only for those who eat too much, and you should never sleep on your left side because that is where your heart is, and you don't want to put too much pressure on that! Meh... you know what? That did actually make sense... but I'm getting buried on my back.

Well, after going to a few Riads trying to find the Riad Kech, we got back to our hotel. We thanked our guide, and went to our restaurant. It was really cool watching Mr. Naiima (I probably spelled that wrong) cook in thos traditional pots. Anyway, with the help of google translate and  handwaving, we paid for our food, and ate. It was really good.

I'm not going to say how we slept that night, because I have more stuff to write so:

##### Seeya!
